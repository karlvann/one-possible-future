Karl's Expert Opinion: Stop buying soft foam mattresses for side sleeping; you're solving the wrong problem. The pressure points come from springs that aren't matched to your body weight. if you're over 80kg, you actually need firmer springs with better cushioning on top.

---

If you've researched mattresses for side sleeping, you've probably heard the same advice everywhere: "Side sleepers need a soft or plush mattress." It's repeated so often that it seems like gospel. But here's the thing, it's dangerously oversimplified.

A 60kg side sleeper and a 100kg side sleeper have completely different needs. Recommending the same "soft" foam mattress to both is like selling the same suspension to a sedan and a pickup truck. One's going to bottom out, the other's going to ride like a brick.

From someone who works with these materials all day, every day for over a decade, I can tell you the real issue: it's not about soft versus firm, it's about matching spring tension to body weight. Get that wrong, and no amount of pillow-top foam will save you.

## The marshmallow on a table analogy

Let me explain what's actually happening when side sleepers get pressure points, because it's not what most people think.

Imagine putting a marshmallow on a table and pushing your finger down through it. At first, it feels soft, right? But if you push hard enough (or long enough), your fingertip hits the table underneath. That's when it starts to hurt. Your fingertip is getting a disproportionate amount of pressure, not because the marshmallow is too firm, but because you've pushed through it entirely.

Your hip is the same as that fingertip. When you lie on your side on a mattress with the wrong spring tension for your body weight, your hips and shoulders push through the comfort layers (the marshmallow) and land directly on top of the springs (the table). That contact point becomes a pressure point.

The mainstream solution? Add more marshmallow (more foam, softer foam, memory foam, pillow tops). But that doesn't solve the problem. You know what actually solves it? **Soften the table.** Get the spring tension right for your body weight so the springs themselves can contour around your hips and shoulders.

## Body weight + spring tension = pressure relief

Here's the data from 15 years of operational experience with thousands of customers:

**Body weight to spring tension matching:**

- **Under 65kg:** Soft spring tension (not soft foam—soft _springs_)
- **65-80kg:** Medium spring tension
- **80-110kg:** Firm spring tension
- **Over 110kg:** Extra firm spring tension

Yes, you read that right. If you're an 85kg side sleeper, you likely need _firm_ springs under you, not a softer mattress.

This sounds counterintuitive until you understand what's actually happening. I've seen this pattern play out hundreds of times: if you're too light for the springs, they won't yield to your body. Instead, your body will yield to the springs. This causes the body to contort and stretch during the night. If you're too heavy for your springs, you'll have a hammocking effect, and your body will fall out of the middle of your range of motion.

A 50kg person will find most mattresses "too firm" because standard springs won't compress under their light body weight. A 120kg person will find those same mattresses "too soft" because they sink right through them. It's not the mattress quality, it's the relationship between body weight and spring tension.

## Why heavier side sleepers (80kg+) struggle with foam mattresses

If you're 80kg or heavier and sleep on your side, bed-in-a-box foam mattresses are especially problematic. Here's why:

If you're upwards of 80kg, sleep on your side, and are slightly fussy with comfort… you're not looking for a good mattress. You're looking for a person with integrity to guide you to the right comfort/support/durability/pressure relief.

The problem is that foam (even high-quality memory foam or latex) has a limited ability to distribute pressure compared to properly designed pocket springs. When you're heavier, there's more force concentrated on your hips and shoulders. Foam compresses, but it doesn't _contour_ the way properly tensioned pocket springs can.

This is especially true because:

1. **Foam-only mattresses typically come in one firmness** (maybe two)
2. **That firmness is rarely matched to your specific body weight**
3. **Over time, foam compresses permanently under heavier weights,** creating dips in the hip and shoulder areas

I've heard this story so many times I could recite it in my sleep: "Usually around the 4-5 year mark the memory foam softens at the hips and you start to hit the firmer layers/springs. If you are heavier than average it happens faster."

I pull apart old mattresses regularly. Memory foam is always very soft around the hip area. Always. The latex ones? They hold up way better.

## What "point elasticity" actually means (and why it matters)

Here's a term you won't see in most mattress marketing: **point elasticity.** It's the ability of a mattress to conform and respond to pressure at a specific point without affecting the surrounding areas.

Think about it: when you're on your side, your hips and shoulders create concentrated pressure points. A mattress with high point elasticity allows those areas to sink in independently while keeping your waist and legs properly supported.

Foam can't do this effectively. Even good foam distributes pressure somewhat, but it's a slow, compression-based response. A properly designed pocket spring system, on the other hand, has independent coils that compress exactly where pressure is applied and stay firm everywhere else.

But—and this is critical—**most pocket springs in Australia are poorly designed.** Manufacturers glue non-stretch fabric to the top of the springs, which negates the independence of the coils. They might as well be regular springs at that point. Absolute nightmare to deal with, but I like to keep things simple.

A properly designed pocket spring system has:

- **High coil count:** 986+ springs in a queen (compared to 600 in most cheap pocket spring mattresses)
- **Honeycomb arrangement:** Springs nested together to increase density and point elasticity
- **No glued top layers:** Allows springs to move independently
- **Multiple spring tensions available:** Matched to body weight

## Hybrid mattress vs foam mattress

The best mattress for side sleepers isn't "all foam" or "all springs." It's a hybrid approach, but not the way most hybrid mattresses are made.

Here's the right approach:

1. **Start with body-weight-matched pocket springs** (986 springs in a queen, honeycomb pattern, appropriate tension for your weight)
2. **Add micro-springs for enhanced contouring** (1,600-3,200 micro coils for deep pressure relief at hips and shoulders)
3. **Use minimal foam, just enough so you don't feel the springs** (5cm of latex or high-density foam, not 10-15cm)

Why minimal foam? Because any foam stores heat, and thick foam reduces the point elasticity you just created with those springs. The foam is there so you don't feel the springs poking you, that's it. The springs are doing 90% of the pressure distribution work.

I use the minimum amount of foam possible. This is because any foam will heat up. The less foam, the less heat. I use all the springs to get the comfort right. Then the foam is only there, so you don't feel the springs. In this case, the latex really moulds to the pocket springs underneath so the shoulders and hips can sink right in.

### For heavier side sleepers: firmer support + better cushioning

If you're 100kg+ and sleep on your side, here's the counterintuitive truth: you need _firmer_ support springs, but you also need _more_ cushioning on top to distribute the concentrated pressure at your hips and shoulders.

For heavier people, I increase the spring tension from medium to extra firm, but I also make sure the top is well-padded. Heavier people will have a more challenging time with comfort because there is more weight to be distributed. So I don't think saying "firmer is better if you are heavy" is accurate. I think it's more accurate to say, "firmer support is required so the body doesn't hammock" is more accurate. You can still put soft foams up the top to help with circulation.

This is why you might need:

- Extra firm pocket springs (to prevent hammocking and keep your spine aligned)
- Double layer of micro-springs (for enhanced contouring at pressure points)
- 5cm of soft latex (to cushion the initial contact)

The firm springs stop you from sinking too far (which would misalign your spine). The micro-springs and latex create the pressure relief at your hips and shoulders. You get support _and_ comfort, not a trade-off between the two.

## Why bed-in-a-box mattresses fail heavier side sleepers

Most [bed-in-a-box mattresses](/guides/bed-in-a-box-pros-and-cons), whether foam, hybrid, or "luxury," share the same fatal flaw: **one-size-fits-all spring tension.**

Think about it like a car's suspension. Would you put sedan springs in a pickup truck? Of course not, it would bottom out immediately. Yet that's exactly what happens when a 100kg person lies on a mattress designed with springs calibrated for a 70kg body.

For heavier side sleepers, the problem compounds:

**1. Foam compression:** Memory foam and polyfoam compress faster under heavier loads. That "pressure relief" layer? It's gone within months, leaving you on springs that were never right to begin with.

**2. Bottoming out:** You sink through the comfort layers until your hips hit the firmer base foam or springs. This creates the exact pressure points the mattress promised to eliminate.

**3. Sagging:** Many "sagging" complaints from heavier sleepers aren't about defective mattresses; they're about springs that were too soft from day one. The spring tension was wrong for your body weight.

I hear this constantly: "I've used many bed-in-a-box mattresses over the last several years and every single one dips in the middle after only a few months."

That's not bad luck. That's the wrong spring tension.

## What we do at Ausbeds

So enough ranting about what doesn't work. Let me tell you what actually does work, and why I designed my mattresses the way I did.

Instead of piling on foam and hoping for the best, Ausbeds uses a three-part system that addresses the actual problem:

### 1. Body-weight-matched spring tension

When you order an Ausbeds mattress, the spring tension is selected based on your body weight:

- Under 65kg: Soft springs
- 65-80kg: Medium springs
- 80-110kg: Firm springs
- Over 110kg: Very firm springs

From my experience, I can guess which spring tension to put in a person's mattress based purely on body weight. It's not random. I've been doing this long enough to know.

The springs hold you at the correct height, not sinking too far (hammocking), not pressing back against you (contorting). This is the foundation everything else builds on.

**For side sleepers, this means:**

- Your hips sink just enough to keep your spine aligned
- Your shoulders can drop into the mattress naturally
- The springs absorb and distribute pressure without bottoming out

### 2. Micro springs for pressure relief

Here's where AusBeds diverges from bed-in-a-box hybrids. Instead of thick foam layers, the Aurora and Cloud models use micro springs, 1,600 to 3,600 of them, depending on size and model.

I tested putting micro-springs under latex, against polyfoam under latex. The vast majority of people preferred the feel of the micro-springs.

Micro springs provide:

- **Contouring without heat retention:** Springs breathe, foam traps heat
- **Pressure distribution:** Each micro spring responds independently
- **Long-term durability:** Springs don't compress and soften like foam

The **Cloud model** (maximum side sleeper comfort) uses **dual layers** of micro springs (3,200 for Queen, 3,600 for King) for the deepest contouring while maintaining support. It's the perfect blend between plush and medium support, very supportive without leaving you feeling like you're perched on top of the bed or sinking into it.

### 3. Minimal latex (not thick foam)

AusBeds uses only 5cm of natural latex on top, just enough so you don't feel the springs, but not so much that it traps heat or compresses under heavier weights.

The more foam, the more heat. I use the minimum amount of foam possible. The latex is just there so you don't feel the springs.

**Why this matters for heavier side sleepers:**

- Latex doesn't soften and dip at the hips like memory foam
- Natural latex lasts 3-4 times longer than polyurethane foam
- Less foam means less heat retention
- When it does eventually wear (after years), you can replace just that 5cm layer, not the entire mattress

I had models where the entire mattress was the same, only the 5cm of foam on top was different… Latex, very few issues, but memory foam has lots of issues. I pull apart old mattresses. Memory foam is always very soft around the hip area.

## Comparing options: What should you actually buy?

Let me break down your options. All just my opinion, of course, but I've done this for a long time.

### Typical bed-in-a-box (Koala, Sleeping Duck, etc.)

Construction:

- 5-10cm memory foam or polyfoam comfort layer
- Foam transition layers
- Pocket springs (one tension for all weights)
- Foam encasement edges

**For heavier side sleepers:**

- ❌ Spring tension not matched to body weight
- ❌ Foam compresses faster under heavier loads
- ❌ "Medium-firm" springs bottom out under 90kg+ bodies
- ❌ Can't adjust firmness after purchase
- ❌ The entire mattress must be replaced when the foam wears

**Price:** $1,200-$2,000 (Queen)
**Trial:** 100-120 nights (return only, no adjustments)

I've heard this from multiple customers: "I tried Koala but found it too soft for my liking. Ended up with Ausbeds after visiting their showroom. The ability to change firmness layers is a game-changer."

### Ausbeds Aurora (natural latex + microsprings)

**Construction:**

- 5cm natural latex (not petroleum foam)
- 1,600 micro springs (Queen) for contouring
- 986 honeycomb pocket springs (body-weight-matched tension)
- Wire edge for breathability

**For heavier side sleepers:**

- ✅ Spring tension specifically selected for your weight (80kg+, 110kg+)
- ✅ Micro springs provide pressure relief without foam compression
- ✅ Minimal latex won't soften at the hips like memory foam

Customer feedback: "This bed is incredible, so soft but supportive at the same time." Another customer with chronic shoulder pain from side sleeping: "Within days my shoulder pain was gone and my neck pain is gone."

## Motion transfer: what reduces partner disturbance

If you share your bed and one of you is a side sleeper who tosses and turns, motion transfer matters. Here's the truth: pocketed coils reduce motion transfer way better than continuous coil systems, but they're not magic.

The best motion isolation comes from modular foam layers:

1. **High coil count** (986 vs 600 springs makes a huge difference)
2. **Honeycomb arrangement** (springs work independently)
3. **Micro springs layer** (absorbs movement at the surface)
4. **Minimal foam layers** (counterintuitively, thick foam can transfer movement in waves)

Memory foam mattresses do excel at motion isolation, I'll give them that. Memory foam is the champ when it comes to partner disturbance. But for side sleepers over 80kg, you're trading motion isolation for pressure relief and durability, and that's usually not a trade worth making.

## Mattress for side sleepers

Alright, let's bring this all together. If you're shopping for a mattress for side sleepers, here's what actually matters:

**1. Body weight matched spring tension** (this is 80% of getting it right)
**2. High coil count pocket springs** (986+ for a queen)
**3. Micro springs or latex for pressure relief** (not thick memory foam)
**4. Minimal foam layers** (heat management and durability)
**5. Adjustability** (because nobody gets it perfect on the first try)

The best mattress for side sleepers isn't determined by reviews or marketing. It's determined by whether the springs are right for your body weight and whether the comfort layers provide pressure relief without trapping heat or breaking down.

For heavier side sleepers (80kg+), this is even more critical. You need firmer springs than you think, plus better cushioning on top. It sounds contradictory, but it's the only thing I've seen work consistently over 15 years.

If you're in Sydney, come try them in the showroom. If you're interstate, we can work it out with our trial period and component swaps. Either way, focus on getting the springs right first. Everything else is just details.

## FAQs

### What type of mattress do doctors recommend for side sleepers?

Doctors don't recommend specific mattress types. They recommend whatever keeps your spine aligned and relieves pressure on your hips and shoulders. The "best mattress for side sleepers" isn't about a brand or a medical endorsement. It's about matching spring tension to your body weight, such as with [latex mattresses](https://www.ausbeds.com.au/mattresses) that offer adjustable firmness.

Here's what actually matters: when you sleep on your side, your hips and shoulders need to sink into the mattress enough to keep your spine straight. If the springs are too firm for your body weight, your body contorts around them all night. If the springs are too soft, you hammock and lose optimal support

### What firmness of mattress Is best for a side sleeper?

Body weight determines firmness, not sleep position. A 50kg side sleeper needs a completely different sleeper mattress than a 120kg side sleeper. Same position, opposite firmness requirements.

Here's the breakdown:

- **Under 65kg:** Level 3 (softer) – You need soft springs so your body doesn't contort
- **65-80kg:** Level 6 (medium) – The sweet spot for most side sleepers
- **80-110kg:** Level 9 (firmer springs, still cushioned on top) – You need firm mattresses for support, but with cushioning foam or latex layers for pressure relief
- **Over 110kg:** Level 12+ – Extra firm springs with well-padded comfort layers

A best side sleeper mattress isn't about picking "soft" or "firm." It's about matching spring tension to your weight, then adding the right amount of cushioning on top for great pressure relief.

Most side sleepers end up in the medium to medium-firm range. But "medium firm" at one brand feels completely different at another, there's no standard. That's why you need to test the actual mattress, not chase firmness ratings. If you can't test in person, order based on your body weight and use the 3-9 month trial period to dial it in. We include 2 free component swaps so you can change latex layers or spring tension until it's the perfect mattress.

### What is the best mattress for side sleepers in Australia?

I make mattresses in Australia, so I'm biased. But here's what actually works for side sleepers: latex or micro springs on pocket springs, made by someone who matches spring tension to body weight. Avoid bed-in-a-box all-foam mattresses if you're over 80kg and sleep on your side. They're usually made firm for stomach sleepers, and they don't provide the contouring a side sleeper needs. You'll end up with pressure points, or you'll sink through the soft cushioning and hit the base layer.

### Which is the best mattress for side sleepers?

There is no single best mattress. I have 15 different firmness configurations in my business for this reason. People buy super soft, all the way to super firm, and everything in between.

Two 95kg side sleepers can need completely opposite firmness levels. One ends up on [Cloud 3](/mattresses/cloud) (much softer), the other on Cloud 12 (much firmer). Same weight, same sleep position, opposite personal preference.

"Firm mattresses" usually means firm springs AND firm comfort layers—that's terrible for side sleepers because your hips and shoulders get no relief.

What you actually want: firm or medium springs (matched to your weight) with soft or medium latex on top. This gives you robust edge support and core support, but still allows pressure to relieve where you need it.

Firm mattress configurations work for heavier side sleepers (over 100kg) or people who prefer sleeping almost on top of the mattress rather than sinking in. But even then, you need cushioning where your hips hit.

### How do I choose between memory foam, latex, and hybrid mattresses for side sleeping?

Don't choose memory foam. I sold it for years alongside latex, and the difference was stark. Same mattress, only the 5cm comfort layer was different. Latex had very few issues, memory foam had lots of issues.

People called about the "stuck" effect, the firmness changing in winter, the heat, and dipping around the hip area. When I pulled apart old memory foam mattresses, the foam was always soft and broken down where the hips and shoulders were. Copper-infused foam and gel memory foam don't solve these problems—they're still petroleum-based foam that breaks down.

### What about testing and selection process for the right mattress?

Lay on it. Close your eyes. Feel the bloody thing. That's the only testing process that matters. When the lights go out at night, all the marketing claims disappear and you're left with how it feels. Does it press against your hip? Too firm. Do you feel like you're sinking? Too soft. You're looking for a neutral feel where your spine stays straight and nothing hurts.

**If you're in Sydney:** Come to the Marrickville showroom. I'll ask about your body weight and sleep position. You'll lie on the different firmness levels for as long as you need. We'll dial in the right spring tension and latex firmness before you leave.

**If you're interstate:** Order based on your body weight using the guide above. You get a 3-9 month trial period with 2 free component swaps (delivery fees apply). If the initial configuration isn't right, we ship new components and you adjust at home (takes 10-20 minutes, no special tools).

We don't have a certified sleep science coach or testing team, we have 13 years of data from thousands of customers, and a modular system that lets us change any component until it's the ideal mattress for you.

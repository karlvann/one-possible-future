Karl's opinion: The fundamental issue with standard mattresses is that they are sealed blocks. Once you buy them, you are stuck with them. If the springs are good but the foam goes soft, you have to throw the entire mattress away. It’s wasteful and inefficient.

This is why I make modular mattresses. It is a sensible, logical evolution in how we design beds. At Ausbeds, we allow you to adjust the feel, replace worn-out components, and save money in the long run.


I've spent the last 15 years running a mattress factory in Marrickville, and if there is one thing I have learned, it is that the "perfect mattress" is a moving target. What feels right today might not feel right in a few years when your body has changed.

## What is a modular mattress?

A modular mattress is designed with interchangeable components rather than being glued and sewn shut. Instead of a sealed tape edge, you have a high-quality zippered cover. When you unzip the cover, you gain access to the internal layers of the mattress.

The modular design typically consists of a support base—usually pocket springs or high-density foam—and separate comfort layers sitting on top. These layers are not glued to each other. Friction and the tight fit of the cover keep them perfectly in place.

Because the internals are accessible, you have control. You can rearrange foam and felt layers to change the firmness. You can flip the springs for a different feel. You can remove a layer to air it out. Most importantly, if a specific part fails, you replace just that part, not the whole new mattress.

## The problem with standard mattresses

To understand why a modular mattress is superior, you have to look at how traditional mattress types are made. In most premium mattresses, the manufacturer creates a support system (springs) and glues several layers of foam on top. They then seal it with a tape edge.

In my experience, the support springs in a high-quality mattress can last 20 years or more. However, the top layer—the comfort layer—takes the brunt of your body weight every single night. It compresses, absorbs sweat, and endures friction. Naturally, the foam layer softens and degrades much faster than the steel springs beneath it.

In a standard design, when that top layer fails and dips, the bed is ruined. You lose support and comfort. You have to arrange a council pickup and spend thousands on a new mattress just because three inches of foam failed. It makes no sense to throw out an entire mattress when only one layer needs replacing.


## Adjusting for the perfect feel

One of the biggest anxieties when you purchase a bed is getting the firmness wrong. You might think you want a firm mattress, but after a week, you realise it's putting pressure on your hips.

With a modular mattress, you aren't locked in. These mattresses usually come with the ability to rearrange and flip layers of the mattress to adjust the firmness levels.

This is particularly useful for different sleepers. If you are a side sleeper, you generally need a softer mattress surface to allow your shoulder to sink in. Back sleepers and stomach sleepers usually require a medium-firm to firm surface to keep the spine from sinking in. A modular design allows you to create the mattress that suits your sleep style.

### Partner disturbance

Sleeping with a partner adds another layer of complexity. You might like a rock-hard surface, while your partner wants a cloud. In a traditional king or queen bed, one of you usually has to compromise.

With a modular design, the comfort layers can often be split. We can set up the left side as medium firm and the right side as firm. This ensures both you and your partner get the restful sleep you need without too much compromise.

### Materials matter: foam, latex, and springs

A modular mattress is only as good as what you put inside it. I use a hybrid mattress, which combines pocket springs with foam on top. I prefer this setup. You get the airflow and support of springs with the pressure relief of high-quality foam. I always tell people to look for high-density foams and bodyweight-matched springs.

- 

**Latex: **A natural, durable foam. It provides superior support and is naturally resistant to dust mites. It lasts 3-4x as long as any plastic foam on the market. I've written about [natural latex here](/guides/the-truth-about-natural-latex-mattresses).

- 

**Bodyweight-matched springs: **The most important thing for mattress support. Just 0.1mm of wire gauge will make all the difference. I've written about [pocket springs here](/guides/the-truth-about-pocket-spring-mattresses).

### Hygiene and maintenance

Let's be honest: mattresses get dirty. You sweat litres into your bed every year. Dust mites accumulate. In a standard mattress, that sweat and dust go through the cover and sit in the foam forever.

With a modular setup, hygiene is much simpler.

- 

**Washable covers:** The top cover can be unzipped. Most are designed to be machine-washed (usually with a mild detergent on a gentle cycle).

- 

**Spot cleaning: **If you spill coffee on the bed, you can unzip the cover and spot clean the foam layer directly. You can't do that with a standard bed.

- 

**Airing out: **You can take the layers out and put them near an open window (or even in a new window of sunlight) to air them out.

*Please note: while you can machine wash the cover, always check the label. Usually, you should tumble dry on low or air-dry it. Never dry-clean foam, and never soak it completely.*

### The environmental impact

We send thousands of tonnes of mattresses to landfills in Australia every year. It is an environmental disaster. The vast majority of these discarded mattresses have perfectly good springs, but the comfort layer has softened.

By using a modular mattress, you extend the life of the bed. When the top layer softens after 5 or 7 years, you buy a new foam insert for a fraction of the cost of a new mattress. You throw away a small piece of foam, not a massive metal and fabric brick. This significantly reduces the environmental impact. (Thus, our philosophy, "[the last mattress you'll ever buy.](/about/our-philosophy)")

## Finding the right mattress

When you look for the best mattress, ignore the flashy marketing terms. Focus on the density of the foam and the customisation options.

At Ausbeds, I like to be upfront. I don't claim to have invented sleep. I just utilise materials that work. High-density foams, quality pocket springs, and a design that lets you fix it if it breaks.

Whether you choose memory foam mattresses, foam mattresses, or hybrid mattresses, ensure they are modular. It takes the risk out of the purchase. If you get it home and it's too firm, you can change it. If it gets dirty, you can wash it. If it wears out, you can fix it.

It strikes the perfect balance between comfort and support, and it respects your wallet.

## Summary of benefits

- **Adjustability: **Adjust firmness levels to suit your body.

- **Longevity:** Replace a single layer rather than the entire mattress.

- **Hygiene:** Breathable cover that is removable and washable.

- **Risk-free:** If the firmness isn't right, you can change it within a few days rather than returning the whole bulky item.

### Frequently asked questions


**Q: Can I replace the components in my mattress?**

Yes, that is the entire point of the modular system. You can change any component of an Ausbeds mattress, including the cover, latex comfort layer, felt supports and the spring system. Moving around the layers into different configurations will allow you to adjust the feel of the mattress. Worn components can be replaced for cheap without having to throw away the entire mattress.


**Q: How much does it cost to replace parts in my mattress?**

Most components are around $350 or less. We have a simple rule - never more than 1/4 of your original mattress price per component. You'll also pay a delivery fee (usually it's the same cost as the mattress delivery, unless we can ship it using AusPost). We don't profit from component swaps - our goal is to help your mattress last forever. Comparing this to the $2000+ cost of purchasing a whole new mattress of similar quality, it is a massive saving.


**Q: Is the King Living Sleep+ modular mattress good?**

I often get asked about competitors. The King Living Sleep+ is a decent product. They use quality materials, and the modular design is sound. However, it is very expensive. You are paying a significant premium for the brand name. You can often get similar or better quality materials and the same modular functionality from smaller manufacturers (like us) for a much lower price.

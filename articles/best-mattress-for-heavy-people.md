When you're over 90kg, finding a mattress that actually supports your weight properly becomes crucial. I've spent 15+ years watching heavier customers struggle with mattresses that sag within months, develop permanent body impressions, or feel like concrete slabs. The problem isn't your weight, it's that most mattresses aren't designed with proper weight-based support in mind.

### Key takeaways

- **It's all about the right springs:** The most important part of a mattress is the spring system. The spring tension must be matched to your body weight. Most "one-size-fits-all" mattresses fail because they are designed for a 60-80kg person.
- **Support vs. comfort:** Heavier sleepers (over 90kg) need *firmer support* (from springs) to prevent spinal misalignment, but *more comfort* (from foam layers) to provide pressure relief. A simple firm mattress is often the wrong choice, as it can cause shoulder and hip pain.
- **Edge support:** For heavier bodies, look for mattresses with reinforced edge support (ideally, firmer coils around the perimeter) to increase the usable sleep surface and prevent side-wall collapse.
- **Go for natural latex:** The comfort layer is usually the first part to fail for heavier sleepers. Natural latex is significantly more durable than high-density foam or memory foam. I've seen memory foam fail in as little as 1-2 years under a heavier body weight.
- **Avoid the [heat trap](/guides/is-a-latex-mattress-hot-to-sleep-on):** Heavier sleepers often sleep hot because they sink deeper into foam. Memory foam mattresses are notorious for trapping body heat. The best cooling mattresses are springs + latex, which allow for much better airflow.

### Why does body weight matter when selecting a mattress?

Body weight determines how much you compress mattress springs. Heavier bodies need firmer springs for extra support, while lighter bodies need softer springs to avoid feeling too firm. It's exactly like a car suspension.

Think about it this way: Imagine taking a large 4WD to a mechanic who mistakenly installs suspension designed for a small sedan. At first, it might feel okay, but soon you'll notice problems. The 4WD leans heavily around corners, bottoms out over bumps. You'd complain, "this suspension is crap!" There's nothing wrong with the quality; it's just the wrong suspension for your truck's weight.

Conversely, put 4WD suspension in that little sedan, and the ride would be harsh and bumpy. You'd feel every crack in the road because the springs are too stiff for the car's lighter weight.

Mattresses are human suspension systems. Their job is to suspend your body correctly while you sleep, keeping your spine aligned. Yet the vast majority of the mattress industry ignores this fundamental principle.

### What happens when springs are too soft for heavy bodies?

When springs are too soft for your body weight, you experience the "hammocking effect": your body falls out of the middle range of motion, causing your spine to curve unnaturally. This is what people call "lack of support."

For a 100kg person on springs designed for someone weighing 60kg, the results are predictable:

- Immediate sinking into the mattress
- Lower back pain from poor spinal alignment
- Accelerated foam breakdown (the foam gets crushed between your weight and the inadequate springs)
- Permanent body impressions within 6-12 months

I recently had a customer tell me his Aurora mattress was sagging after two years. When I investigated, the springs weren't quite firm enough for him from the start—he was just too heavy for them. After installing firmer springs, he no longer thought the latex was dipped. His body had been looking for firmer spring tension all along.

### What happens when springs are too firm for your weight?

If springs are too firm for your body weight, the foam crushes between your weight and the top of the springs. The foam takes all the punishment instead of the springs sharing the load.

This causes:

- Pressure points on the hips and shoulders
- Poor circulation from excessive pressure
- Rapid foam deterioration (often within 2-3 years)
- The feeling of sleeping "on top" rather than "in" the mattress

When people try to use thick coils as a selling point of quality, I'm completely baffled. You don't need high gauge coils—you need the *right* coils for your weight.

## Spring tension recommendations by weight range

Here's my spring tension guide based on 15+ years of fitting mattresses:


| **Weight** | **Under 65kg** | **65-85kg** | **80-110kg** | **Over 110kg** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spring wire thickness** | 1.5mm | 1.6mm | 1.7mm | 1.8mm |
| **Firmness scale (mattress feels)** | 3 (Soft) | 6 (Medium) | 9 (Medium-firm mattress) | 12 (Very firm mattress) |
| **Recommended models** | Aurora 3 Cooper 3 | Cloud 6 Aurora 6 Cooper 6 | Cloud 9 Aurora 9 Cooper 9 | Cloud 12 Aurora 12
Note: Cooper only goes up to level 9. |

At 100kg, you need **more** mattress; it's as simple as that.

I have a motorbike, and getting the suspension right for your bodyweight is crucial. The heavier you are, the firmer the suspension. A mattress is no different.

## Edge support is non-negotiable

A lack of edge support is that feeling of instability when you sit on the side of the bed to put your shoes on, or the sensation that you might roll right off during the night. For heavier sleepers, this is one of the most common complaints.

Most mattresses for heavy people fail here. They use a standard pocket spring unit across the entire mattress. For heavier sleepers, this isn't enough. Your body weight compresses the outer springs, and the whole side collapses. This lack of edge support dramatically shrinks your usable sleep surface.

This is why reinforced edge support is so important. At Ausbeds, we use a firmer edge on our spring unit. The outer rows of coils are made from a thicker wire (1.8mm) than the main support core (which might be 1.6mm or 1.7mm, depending on your weight). This creates strong edge support that can handle your body weight when sleeping near the edge.

Some companies, particularly in the bed-in-a-box market, use what they call a 'foam box' for edge support. This is just a perimeter of high-density foam around the springs. In my experience, this is a major point of failure. Heavier bodies will break down that foam wall in 12-24 months, leaving you with a soft side. Solid edge support must come from reinforced coils, not just dense foam.

Good edge support does two things: it gives you a stable seating edge, and it increases the usable sleep surface of your queen-size mattress. You can sleep right to the edge without feeling unsupported. For heavier sleepers, supportive mattresses start with excellent edge support.

## How much comfort layer do heavy people need?

Heavier sleepers face a unique challenge: you need firmer springs to prevent hammocking, but firmer springs create more pressure on hips and shoulders. The solution isn't to go softer on springs (that causes sagging)—it's to add more cushioning on top. This is where pressure relief becomes the focus.

In the 90kg+ weight range, I find 10cm of comfort materials above the springs is commonly preferred (compared to 7cm for average weights). This extra cushioning, or comfort layer, distributes pressure away from pressure points without compromising support. This is how you get excellent pressure relief.

For my heavier customers, I often recommend:

- **Natural latex over memory foam**: Latex offers better durability and pressure relief distribution. Memory foam tends to bottom out.
- **Micro-springs in the comfort layer**: Adds cushioning without sacrificing support.
- **Higher density foams only**: Minimum 35kg/m³ for polyfoam, though I prefer latex. High-density foam is a must.

## Why do mattresses fail faster for heavy people?

Let me give you realistic timelines for foam breakdown based on body weight:

#### Memory foam lifespan (8cm layer)

- 60kg person: 5-6 years
- 80kg person: 3-4 years
- 100kg person: 2-3 years
- 120kg person: 1-2 years

#### High-density polyfoam:

- 60kg person: 8-10 years
- 80kg person: 6-7 years
- 100kg person: 4-5 years
- 120kg person: 3-4 years

#### Natural latex:

I haven't witnessed dipped latex in 15 years, regardless of bodyweight

This is why I believe at 100kg+, extra attention must be paid to foam type—it's the component you'll have problems with first.

## Heavy people are hot sleepers

Your body generates heat that must go somewhere. Foam insulates by trapping air in tiny pockets. The more foam volume, the more heat gets trapped. I did a whole video explaining this concept (you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MynScW_7RsY).)

For heavier people who sink deeper into mattresses, this creates a perfect storm:

- More body surface area in contact with foam
- Deeper impressions mean more foam surrounding you
- Less airflow around your body
- Result: sleeping hot and sweaty

If you sleep hot, minimise foam volume. A spring mattress with thinner comfort layers allows you to dissipate body heat much more effectively than a thick all-foam mattress you sink deeply into.

## What about couples with large weight differences?

When [partners](/support/half-half-mattress) have significantly different weights, standard mattresses create problems:

- **Weight difference under 30kg: **Choose based on the heavier partner's needs. The lighter person can adapt more easily than the heavier person can tolerate inadequate support.
- **Weight difference over 30kg:** I recommend dual comfort construction. I cut and join two different spring units, with each side getting appropriate spring tension. I use hot glue to join individual pocket springs, making the centre seam seamless. The only difference is spring tension. This also improves motion transfer, giving you good motion isolation.

For extreme cases (one person over 100kg, the other under 80kg), the heavier person should have a 1.8mm coil thickness, while the lighter person gets a 1.6mm coil thickness.

## Recommendations: Best mattresses for fat people

When looking for the best mattresses for heavy people, the *type* of mattress is a major consideration. Let's break down the common options.

### For the 90-120kg range

I often recommend mattresses with:

- Firmer pocket springs (1.7-1.8mm wire)
- Higher spring count (1160+ in queen size vs standard 870)
- Natural latex comfort layers
- Micro-springs for extra cushioning without compromising support

Avoid these common mistakes:

- All-foam mattresses (inadequate support, rapid breakdown)
- Memory foam in high-wear areas (breaks down fastest)
- "One-size-fits-all" firmness (usually too soft or too firm)
- Thin comfort layers on firm springs (creates pressure points)

## The Ausbeds [approach](/about/how-it-works)

At Ausbeds, I've addressed the weight problem by:

- Developing different spring units with varying tensions for specific weight ranges that offer excellent pressure relief
- Using a honeycomb spring configuration (30% more springs than standard)
- Using eco-friendly, cooling and durable materials
- Offering replaceable layers (when foam wears out, replace just that component)
- Providing a 100-night adjustment period to dial in perfect comfort

I increase coil thickness from 1.6mm to 1.8mm for heavier people, but also ensure the top is well-padded. You need firmer support so your body doesn't hammock, but you can still use soft foams up top to help with circulation.

## Warning signs your mattress isn't right for your weight

Too soft for your weight:

- Immediate deep sinking
- Lower back pain
- Partner rolls toward you
- Visible body impression when you get up
- Difficulty turning over

Too firm for your weight:

- Pressure points on hips/shoulders
- Numbness or tingling
- Tossing and turning frequently
- Sleeping only on your back feels comfortable
- Waking up stiff and sore


### People also ask

**What is the best mattress for an overweight person?**

The best mattress for fat people (or anyone overweight) is not about a specific brand, but about matching components to your body weight. The key is a hybrid mattress with a spring system that is tensioned correctly for your weight. This provides the support core you need. This must be paired with a thick, durable comfort layer (I recommend natural latex over memory foam) to provide pressure relief and prevent you from feeling the firm springs. You also need to ensure it has strong edge support.

**What is the best mattress for a heavy person in Australia?**

As the owner of Ausbeds, I'm biased, but I'll explain my reasoning. I believe the best mattresses for heavy people in Australia are modular ones, like ours. The reason is that heavier bodies wear out foam layers faster than lighter sleepers. It's just physics.

With a modular mattress from Ausbeds, when that top comfort layer wears out in 3, 5, or 7 years, you can simply unzip the cover and replace it for a few hundred dollars. With a standard 'sealed' mattress from a competitor (like many memory foam mattresses), you have to throw out the entire mattress—including the perfectly good springs—and spend thousands on a new one. For heavier sleepers, a replaceable-part system is the most economical and durable solution.

**What is the best cooling mattress for hot sleepers?**

The best cooling mattress for hot sleepers is almost always a natural latex mattress or a hybrid mattress with latex foam layers. Latex is an open-cell foam that breathes and does not retain body heat the way memory foam or polyfoam does. The coil layers in a hybrid mattress also create a large air-filled space, which allows your body heat to dissipate body heat effectively. Avoid thick memory foam mattresses if you sleep hot, even gel-infused memory foam ones. A breathable cover also helps.

**Should heavier people always choose firm mattresses?**

No, this is oversimplified. Heavier sleepers need *firm support* (springs) to prevent hammocking, but you still need soft comfort layers for pressure relief. The key is getting the right mattress spring tension for your weight, then adding appropriate cushioning on top. Many heavier sleepers end up with a medium-firm feel. A sleep firm mattress might sound right, but a mattress that is too firm will cause pain for side sleepers.

**Why do bed-in-a-box mattresses fail so quickly for heavy people?**

Most use springs that are far too firm, thinking firmer springs won't sag as quickly. But when springs are too firm, your weight crushes the foam (especially memory foam) between your body and the springs. The foam deteriorates faster, not slower. Better to let springs flex properly so foam doesn't take all the punishment. They also often have terrible edge support.

**Can heavy people use memory foam mattresses?**

I rate memory foam as lasting 3 years in the best-case scenarios for average weight. For someone over 90kg, expect 1-2 years before a significant breakdown. If you're heavier and need more support, prepare for disappointment with memory foam. Even the best mattresses using memory foam will struggle with durability under a higher body weight.

**What about latex mattresses for heavy people?**

Natural latex is the best foam option for heavier sleepers. It's like those fitness bands—natural rubber stretches and rebounds like crazy, while synthetic versions stretch and don't come back properly. I've never seen properly made latex develop permanent body impressions. It provides great pressure relief and is a cooling mattress material.

**How much should a heavy person expect to spend on a quality mattress?**

At 100kg+, you need more material, better construction, and high-quality materials. Expect to invest at least $2,000-$3,000 for something that will actually last. Cheaper options (like many online mattresses) might feel okay initially, but will fail within 2-3 years. This price range is where you find the best mattresses for heavy people.

**Can you fix a sagging mattress for a heavy person?**

If springs are adequate but foam has failed, yes—replace the foam layers. If springs are too soft for your weight, you need new springs. At Ausbeds, we can replace components individually rather than the entire mattress. This is impossible with most mattresses that are sealed shut.

**What if I'm over 120kg?**

You'll need maximum support: 1.8-2.0mm spring wire, high spring count, and substantial comfort layers (10cm+) of quality materials. Avoid all-foam constructions entirely. Consider custom solutions with reinforced edge support and a thicker mattress profile. Check the maximum weight limit on any bed frame as well.

Remember: gravity, body weight, and physics are the main factors in choosing a mattress. Most of the rest is marketing nonsense. Get the spring tension right for your weight first, then worry about comfort layers and pressure relief.

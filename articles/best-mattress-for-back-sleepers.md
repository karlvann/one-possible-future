KARL'S QUICK OPINION: Everyone bangs on about “medium-firm for back sleepers,” but that’s marketing crap. Body weight matters way more than sleeping position. A 60kg back sleeper and a 110kg back sleeper need completely different spring tensions. If your springs are too soft for your weight, your waist drops into the mattress, creating a hammock effect that overarches your spine all night. Match your spring tension to your body weight

## **The truth about mattresses for back sleepers**

When you’re shopping for a mattress as a back sleeper, your body weight matters *way* more than the fact that you sleep on your back.

I know. Every article you’ve read says “best mattress for back sleepers” like it’s a specific category of mattress. But here’s what I’ve learned after 15 years of fitting thousands of people to mattresses: a 50kg back sleeper and a 120kg back sleeper need completely different mattresses. Meanwhile, an 80kg back sleeper and an 80kg side sleeper? They’re actually pretty close.

The reason nobody talks about this is simple – it doesn’t market very well. It’s much easier to confuse people with [marketing gimmicks](/guides/mattress-marketing-gimmicks) than to explain simple mattress physics. If you want to avoid back pain and actually sleep well, you need to understand what’s really happening when you sleep.

## **Back pain: why the wrong mattress hurts your back**

When you sleep on your back, there are two very important things at play: gravity and your body weight.

If your springs are too soft for your weight, something bad happens. Your midsection (which is the heaviest part of your body) drops into the mattress more than your shoulders and legs. This creates what I call a hammocking effect – your body falls out of the middle of your range of motion.

Think about it: when you’re standing, your spine has a natural curve. When you lie on your back on the *right* mattress, that curve should stay roughly the same. But when your stomach and hips sink too far into a too-soft mattress, your spine overextends. Your lower back arches backward, pushing your spine to the edges of its movement range. That’s why people have bad sleep and wake up with sore backs.

## **Why back sleepers actually have it easier than side sleepers**

Here’s the good news: as a back sleeper, you’ve got it easier than side sleepers.

When someone sleeps on their side, they have these extreme pressure points – shoulders and hips stick way out. If the mattress is too firm, those pressure points take all the load, and you get circulation issues and pain. If it’s too soft, they sink through the comfort layers and land on top of the springs (think of pushing your finger through a marshmallow onto a table – eventually your fingertip hurts because it’s hitting the hard surface underneath).

But back sleepers? Your weight is distributed much more evenly across your body. No extreme pressure points to manage.

This doesn’t mean any firm mattress will work. You still need the right spring tension for your body weight.

## **Best mattress for back sleepers: the body weight brackets that actually matter**

So here’s what actually determines the best mattress for back pain: getting the spring tension matched to your body weight.

Vispring (a 120-year-old company that really understands this stuff) uses these brackets:

-
**SOFT** – Up to 70kg

-
**MEDIUM** – 70-102kg

-
**FIRM** – 102-127kg

-
**EXTRA FIRM** – Above 127kg

At Ausbeds, our recommendations based on 15 years of data are:

-
**Under 65kg** → Level 3 (Softer) with Soft springs

-
**65-80kg** → Level 6 (Medium) with Medium springs

-
**80-110kg** → Level 9 (Firmer) with Firm springs

-
**Over 110kg** → Level 12 (Very Firm) with Firm springs

Notice what’s *not* in those brackets? Sleep position. Because here’s the truth: if you’re too light for the springs, they won’t yield to your body. Instead, your body will yield to the springs. This causes the body to contort and stretch during the night. If you’re too heavy for your springs, you get that hammocking effect where your body falls out of the middle of your range of motion.

Spring tension to bodyweight is the single biggest determining factor in mattress fit. About 60% of the mattress problem comes from having a spring tension to body weight mismatch.

I really think that getting the springs right for the bodyweight is the single biggest predictor of mattress success. Actually, I take that back, I no longer think that, I experience it working every single day. It’s now common knowledge at Ausbeds. It’s obvious.

## **What “firm enough” actually means**

Here’s where people get confused. They hear “firm support” and think “I need a rock-hard mattress.” That’s wrong.

For heavier people, I increase the spring tension from medium to extra firm, but I also make sure the top is well-padded. Heavier people will have a more challenging time with comfort because there is more weight to be distributed.

So I don’t think saying “firmer is better if you are heavy” is accurate. I think it is more accurate to say, “firmer support is required so the body doesn’t hammock.” You can still put soft foams up the top to help with circulation and comfort.

The goal is this: the springs hold your body weight at the right level (preventing hammocking), while the comfort layers on top distribute pressure evenly so you don’t feel the springs. If you get the spring tension right for your body weight, the padding matters less.

## **Memory foam mattresses vs. hybrid mattress construction: what back sleepers actually need**

Most mattress guides push memory foam mattresses hard, but here’s what they don’t tell you: memory foam doesn’t fix a support problem. I’ve pulled apart hundreds of memory foam mattresses with dipping, and the issue is always the same – the foam layers compress unevenly under body weight.

A hybrid mattress (springs plus foam layers on top) gives you something better: independent support that adjusts to your weight through spring tension, with just enough foam on top so you don’t feel the coils. When I see someone struggling on a traditional memory foam mattress, it’s usually because the foam is too thick or the wrong density for their body weight.

For back sleepers specifically, you don’t need the deep sink of gel memory foam or dense memory foam. You need proper support that keeps your lumbar region at the right height. That’s why I use minimal foam in [Cooper](/mattresses/cooper) (high-density polyfoam, not memory foam) and latex foam in [Aurora](/mattresses/aurora)/[Cloud](/mattresses/cloud) – just enough cushioning without storing heat or creating that quicksand feeling.

## **Quality materials: why they matter more than brand names**

Most mattress marketing talks about “premium materials” without explaining what that means or why it matters to your sleep. Here’s the truth: materials determine how long your mattress lasts and whether your body gets the support it needs.

Every Ausbeds mattress—whether Cooper, Aurora, or Cloud—uses the same core support system that took us years to refine:

**Honeycomb Pocket Springs**: 986 coils for Queen, 1,160 for King (pocketed coils, not innerspring coils, which are cheaper cage springs). We arrange them in a honeycomb pattern instead of rows because we can fit 30% more springs in the same space. More springs means better weight distribution and less pressure on your hips and shoulders. These aren’t generic springs—we source them with 6-7 turns (versus the industry standard 5) for optimal pressure relief and better edge support.

I once ran out of springs and rang someone to use his pocket springs. It turned out there were only 600 pocket springs in the unit. I got so many returns after that. That’s when I realised that if I was getting more returns from having fewer turns and fewer springs, maybe if I increased the turns and the springs, I would get even fewer returns. So I looked at Vispring, which has been operating for 90 years… They used higher coil counts and six turns.

**Natural Latex** (Aurora and Cloud): Our natural latex comes from 323 certified organic farms in Sri Lanka. It lasts 3-4 times longer than petroleum-based foam and doesn’t retain heat the way memory foam does. Density: 70 kg/m³, traceable to specific rubber tree forests. Natural latex mattresses cost more upfront, but you’re not replacing them in five years like most foam mattresses.

**High-Density Polyfoam** (Cooper): 35 kg/m³ density. This isn’t the cheap stuff that dips after six months. And because Cooper uses our modular design, you can replace just the foam layers if they ever wear out—no need to throw away perfectly good springs.

**Micro Springs** (Aurora and Cloud): Queen size gets 1,600 micro coils, King gets 1,800. These sit above the main springs to give you contouring without the “stuck in quicksand” feeling of memory foam. Cloud uses double layers (3,200 for Queen / 3,600 for King) for maximum pressure relief.

As one customer put it: “This is the way to go. Excellent bed, that uses excellent materials. Price is comparable to other thousand dollar beds, but is customisable before and after delivery. I got the Aurora with [half/half ](/support/half-half-mattress)different sides and could not be happier. I had lower lumbar issues on old mattress and this has helped considerably.” — PBz, Aurora Queen.

## **Different sleeping positions: why combination sleepers and hot sleepers still need the right springs**

If you’re a combination sleeper (back and side), you still follow the same rule: body weight first, preferred sleeping position second. The spring tension needs to match your weight, then we adjust the comfort layers. I’ve had combination sleepers do fine on the same spring unit that works for dedicated back sleepers at the same weight.

For hot sleepers, here’s what I’ve learned: thickness of foam matters more than “gel infused memory foam” or any cooling mattress marketing. A thick memory foam layer stores body heat like a frying pan – the thicker the pan, the more heat it holds. That’s why I use thinner latex foam or minimal polyfoam on top of springs, so air can move and heat doesn’t get trapped.

## **The bottom line for back sleepers**

If you’re a back sleeper looking for the best mattress, stop searching for “mattresses for back sleepers” and start looking at your body weight:

-
**Find your weight bracket** – Use the Vispring guide or our recommendations above

-
**Match spring tension to your weight** – This prevents hammocking and keeps your spine in a neutral position for spinal alignment

-
**Don’t overthink the comfort layers** – As a back sleeper, you need less contouring than side sleepers (no extreme pressure points to manage)

-
**Avoid springs that are too soft** – The midsection drop will overarch your back all night

-
**Don’t assume “firm is better”** – You need firm *support* matched to your weight, with appropriate comfort layers on top (not a soft mattress, not a medium mattress, but the right mattress for *your* weight)

I’ve seen it thousands of times: someone comes in asking for a “firm mattress for back sleepers” when they weigh 65kg. They’d be miserable on firm springs. Or someone weighing 115kg buys a “medium firm mattress for back sleepers” and wonders why their back hurts – they’re hammocking all night.

Gravity and body weight are the main factors in choosing a mattress; most of the rest is marketing nonsense.

Get the spring tension right for your body weight, and as a back sleeper, you’ll have a much easier time than side sleepers finding something comfortable. Your weight distribution is more even, you don’t have extreme pressure points, and you’ve got more flexibility in what works (you have a better chance on different mattress types than side sleepers do). But get the spring tension wrong, and no amount of “back sleeper optimised” marketing will save you from a sore back.

And because we build every Ausbeds mattress with dual-sided springs (flip them to adjust mattress firmness by ~10-15%), removable felt layers, replaceable comfort layers, and swappable spring units, you’re never stuck with the wrong firmness. We include 2 free component swaps in your first 3 months, and you can [adjust or upgrade components for life](about/our-philosophy). Think of it as a supportive mattress that adapts to you, not the other way around.

I fit them to something that I feel is keeping the spine aligned, with no pressure points. A firm mattress will often do the opposite. Having the spine at the edges of its movement range is why people have bad sleep.

All just my opinion, of course.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What type of mattress should a back sleeper use?

Back sleepers need a mattress that keeps the spine aligned without creating pressure points. The truth is, there’s no single “back sleeper mattress”—it comes down to your body weight and the spring tension.

I’ve been making mattresses for over 14 years, and here’s what I’ve learned: a 50kg person will find most mattresses “too firm,” while a 120kg person will find the same mattress “too soft.” These two weight ranges sink to very different depths. That same mattress will feel completely different to each person.

A truly supportive mattress for back sleepers starts with the spring unit. If the springs are too soft for your body weight, your hips will sink too far, and your spine will curve. If they’re too firm, you’ll get pressure points and won’t sink in enough.

The best combination I’ve found is bodyweight-matched pocket springs with natural latex on top. Latex on pocket springs to me is the best combination of materials for a mattress. The spring tension and latex density will vary from person to person.

### Is a firm or soft mattress better for back pain?

Here’s the thing—this question assumes there’s a universal answer, but there isn’t. “Soft mattresses are bad for your back” and “firm mattresses are good for your back” aren’t true statements.

The truth is, there are a few very important things at play: gravity and your body weight. If you have a bad back, you have much more to gain by getting the fit exactly right. Some back problems like slipped discs can require an extremely firm mattress to prevent the vertebrae from squashing the swollen discs. Usually though, when someone asks me what’s the best mattress for someone with a bad back, I tell them the same as I tell everyone: the one that fits.

For most back sleepers in the 70-95kg range, a medium firm feel tends to work well. This provides enough support to keep the spine aligned while still allowing some contouring for the natural curve of your lower back.

But here’s the catch: what feels “medium firm” to you depends entirely on your body weight and what mattresses you’ve slept on before. A medium firm feel to someone who weighs 60kg will feel completely different to someone who weighs 100kg.****

### What mattress do chiropractors recommend in Australia?

I can’t speak for all chiropractors, but I can tell you what actually matters for spinal alignment—and what I’ve learned talking to people with back problems every day for over a decade.

Most recommendations you’ll hear focus on “firm” or “orthopaedic” mattresses. The problem is, firmness isn’t the answer. The fit is. Getting the spring tension matched to your body weight is the key to getting this right.

#### **Latex Mattresses for Long-Term Spinal Support**

When it comes to mattress material, natural latex has the highest resiliency of any foam. Real latex doesn’t lose resilience as polyfoam or memory foam does. I’ve spoken to many people changing mattresses after more than 10 years and they’ve told me, “no, it’s really comfy, and there’s no dipping.”

Latex mattresses combined with properly tensioned pocket springs provide consistent support for years. The latex is bulletproof—no sagging. I don’t want people calling me telling me the mattress is sagging, which is why I use latex.****

### Is a hybrid mattress good for back sleepers?

A hybrid mattress typically means springs with foam or latex layers on top. The short answer is: it depends entirely on the spring tension and the quality of materials used.

I’ve been testing different configurations for years. The pinnacle of mattresses, in my opinion, is a pocket spring adjusted to your bodyweight, with a sheet or two of micro-coils, and natural latex on top. I certainly haven’t been able to find a better combination.

#### **Best Hybrid Mattress Configuration**

The best hybrid mattress setup I’ve found uses three key components:

**Top layer:** 5cm natural latex (density matched to your preference)

**Next layer:** Micro springs for added contouring (1,600 for Queen, 1,800 for King)

**Bottom layer:** Bodyweight-adjusted honeycomb pocket springs

I tested putting micro-springs under latex against polyfoam under latex. The vast majority of people preferred the feel of the micro-springs. Micro-springs always bounce back—we haven’t seen any micro-springs with noticeable resilience loss so far.

#### **Cooling Mattress Properties of Hybrids**

If people ask me about what the coolest mattress is, I point to the spring unit. Springs are mostly air, and air doesn’t store heat. However, you don’t want to feel the springs, so you need to add foam.

The more foam you add, the more heat you trap. This is why I use the minimum amount of foam possible. The latex is just there so you don’t feel the springs. Natural latex sleeps cooler than memory foam and polyfoam when all other factors are equal.

#### **Extra Edge Support Considerations**

One thing to consider with hybrid mattresses is edge support. Some manufacturers use foam boxes around the perimeter, others use wire edge support. I use coils all the way to the edge—air all the way to the edge. This promotes better airflow and prevents moisture buildup under the mattress.

When you sit on the side of a mattress with foam edge support, it may feel firmer initially. But coils to the edge provide better long-term durability and breathability.

### What's a Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid alternative?

Brooklyn Bedding are a decent company. They have their own factory and use high-quality materials. However, that information won’t really help you decide if it’s right for you. What you’re looking for is something with high “point elasticity,” which means it can absorb your shoulders and hips but still push your torso up.

Ultimately, finding a well-designed pocket spring that is correct relative to your bodyweight, with high-quality cushioning that suits your personal preferences, will be the pinnacle of mattress comfort. This isn’t found by asking for a brand or asking someone else what they liked, as this combination will be different for everyone.

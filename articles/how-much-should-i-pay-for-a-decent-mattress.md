As someone who has been in the mattress manufacturing business for over 15 years, one of the most common questions I hear is: How much should I pay for a decent mattress? It’s a simple question with a complicated answer. Walk into any big retail store, and you’ll see prices ranging from a few hundred dollars to figures that look more like a down payment on a car.

My factory is in [Marrickville](/showrooms/marrickville), Sydney, and day in and day out, I see exactly what goes into making a mattress. I'm going to give you an honest, no-nonsense breakdown of mattress cost, what you get for your money, and how to find a great bed without getting ripped off. This isn't about marketing spin; it's about helping you make an informed decision for your budget and your well-being.

## Mattress cost: what's behind the price tag?
Understanding why mattresses have such a vast price range is the first step. The price of a mattress isn't arbitrary; it's a calculation based on several factors. When you purchase a new mattress, you're paying for more than just foam and springs.

The most significant factor is the quality of the materials inside. High-density foams, natural latex, and high-count pocket springs simply cost more to source and use than their lower-quality counterparts. A mattress with premium, durable materials will have a higher price but will also provide better support and last longer.

Labour and manufacturing costs are also part of the equation. A simple mattress with a single foam layer is quicker and cheaper to produce than a complex hybrid mattress with multiple layers and hand-tufted details. My experience in mattress manufacturing has shown me that craftsmanship adds to the cost, but it also adds to the quality and longevity of the bed.

Finally, there's the business side. This includes marketing, shipping, showroom costs, and staff wages. Large, well-known brands spend a fortune on advertising, and that cost is passed directly to you, the customer. This is why a mattress from a big brand can have a much higher price than a comparable mattress from a direct-to-consumer company.

## Understanding different mattress types
The type of mattress you choose has a huge impact on both the feel and the price. There are four main mattress types on the market today, each with its own set of characteristics and typical price points.

**Innerspring mattresses:** These are the traditional mattresses many of us grew up with. They use a network of steel coils for support. The simplest and cheapest versions use a Bonnell spring system, where the springs are all interconnected. A better option is a system with pocket springs. Pocket springs are individually wrapped in fabric, allowing them to move independently. This provides more targeted support and reduces motion transfer, which is great if you share your bed. Generally speaking, the more pocket springs a mattress has, the better the support and the higher the price.

**Foam mattresses:** This is a broad category that includes beds made entirely of foam. The quality and price of foam mattresses vary dramatically based on the type and density of the foam used. Low-density polyurethane foam is cheap but may not be very durable. High-density foams, including memory foam and high-resilience support foams, offer better support and longevity. These mattresses are excellent at contouring to the body and relieving pressure.

**Latex mattresses:** Often considered a premium option, latex mattresses are known for their comfort, durability, and breathability. They have a more responsive, buoyant feel than memory foam. There are two main types: natural or synthetic latex. Natural latex is derived from the sap of rubber trees and is more expensive, while synthetic latex is a petroleum-based alternative. The manufacturing process (Dunlop or Talalay) also affects the feel and cost. A latex mattress is often a worthwhile investment due to its long lifespan. Check out our [Aurora](/mattresses/aurora) or [Cloud](mattresses/cloud) as examples.

**Hybrid mattresses:** Hybrid mattresses aim to combine the best of both worlds. They typically feature a support core of pocket springs, topped with comfort layers of memory foam, latex, or other foams. Check out the [Cooper](/mattresses/cooper) as an example. This construction provides the support and bounce of an innerspring mattress with the pressure relief of a foam mattress. Because they use multiple high-quality materials and have a more complex design, hybrid mattresses often come with a higher price tag than all-foam or basic innerspring beds.

### What's the deal with memory foam mattresses
Memory foam is one of the most popular materials in the mattress market today, and for good reason. Originally developed by NASA, viscoelastic polyurethane foam, or memory foam, is designed to contour precisely to your body shape in response to heat and pressure.

The main benefit of a memory foam mattress is its superior pressure relief. By cradling your shoulders and hips, memory foam helps to keep your spine aligned, which can lead to a better sleep quality. This makes it a great option for a side sleeper or anyone with joint pain.

However, traditional memory foam has a reputation for trapping heat. Modern memory foam mattresses often incorporate new technology to combat this, such as gel infusions or an open-cell structure that promotes airflow. The mattress feels slow-responding, meaning it takes time to return to its original shape. Some people love this sinking feeling, while others find it makes it difficult to change positions during the night. The quality of memory foam mattresses can vary hugely, which is reflected in the price. A cheap mattress might use low-density memory foam that sags quickly, while high-quality mattresses use denser, more durable foams.

### Does mattress firmness affect the price?
A common misconception is that a firm mattress should cost more or less than a soft one. In reality, [mattress firmness](/guides/mattress-firmness-guide) has little to do with the price or quality of the mattress. For a given mattress model, the soft, medium, and firm versions will almost always be the same price.

The cost is determined by the materials and construction, not the firmness level. The choice of mattress firmness is entirely personal and should be based on your body weight, sleeping position, and comfort preference.

**Softer mattresses** are often preferred by side sleepers as they allow the shoulders and hips to sink in, promoting spinal alignment.

**A firm mattress** is typically better for stomach sleepers, as it prevents the hips from sinking too low and arching the back.

**Medium-firm mattresses** are the most popular choice and are often a good compromise for back sleepers and couples with different preferences.

Choosing the right mattress firmness is essential for a good night's sleep, but don't expect it to be the deciding factor in the mattress cost.

## Finding the right mattress for your budget
So, how much should you actually plan to spend? Let's break it down into common price brackets for a queen-size mattress, which is the most popular size for most Aussies.

#### Entry-level: Under $800
In this price range, you're looking at basic mattresses. This might include a simple innerspring mattress with a Bonnell spring system or an all-foam mattress with lower-density foams. If you're on a tight budget, you can find a bed in this range, but it's important to manage your expectations. These beds may not offer the best support and may need replacing sooner than a more expensive mattress. Be wary of a cheap mattress with grand claims; it likely won't hold up over time. It's rare to find high-quality materials in this price bracket.

#### The sweet spot: $800 - $2000
This is the preferred price range for most people and, in my experience, where you get the best value for your money. For this price, you can get a very high-quality mattress, especially from online, direct-to-consumer brands that cut out the retail middleman.

In this range, you'll find excellent hybrid mattresses with robust pocket springs and substantial comfort layers of memory foam or latex. You can also find high-quality foam mattresses and some very good latex mattress options. A queen-size mattress in this range is a solid investment in your sleep and well-being. A bed in this price bracket should offer good durability, support, and comfort for many years.

#### Premium-tier: $2000+
Once you go above the $2000 mark for a queen-size mattress, you enter the premium and luxury market. Does a higher price always mean a better mattress? Not necessarily. In this range, you are often paying for one of two things: either very high-end and natural materials or a well-known brand name.

Mattresses in this price bracket might feature unique features like advanced cooling technologies, extensive layers of natural latex, high-count micro-coils, or premium covers like cashmere or organic wool. However, a significant portion of the cost for many beds in this range can be attributed to massive marketing budgets and brand recognition. You can find as good a mattress for a smaller price from a smaller brand. Before you spend this kind of money, make sure you know exactly what you're paying for in terms of materials and construction.

## How to get the best deal on a new mattress
Your goal shouldn't be to find the cheapest mattress, but to get the best value. That means finding the best possible mattress for your budget. Here are a few tips to help you get the best deal.

1. **[Consider shopping online](/guides/how-to-buy-a-mattress-online):** Traditional brick-and-mortar stores have high overheads—rent, commissions, and showroom costs—which are factored into the mattress price. Online stores have lower overheads, which means they can often offer a better quality mattress for a lower price.

2. **Look beyond the big brands:** Don't assume that the most well-known brands offer the best mattresses. Their prices are often inflated to cover huge advertising budgets. Smaller, direct-to-consumer brands often provide more transparency about their materials and construction, allowing you to make a more informed decision.

3. **Focus on specifications, not jargon:** The mattress market is filled with confusing marketing terms. Instead of focusing on fancy names for foams and fabrics, look for the actual specifications. For a foam mattress, what is the density of the memory foam? For an innerspring or hybrid mattress, how many pocket springs does it have? These details tell you more about the quality of a mattress than any marketing slogan.

4. **Check the trial and warranty:** A reputable company that is confident in its product will offer a generous [in-home sleep trial](/support/warranty) (usually 100 nights or more) and a long warranty (at least 10 years). This allows you to test the new bed in your own bedroom and ensures your purchase is protected against manufacturing defects. Don't forget to check if your current bed base is suitable for your new mattress to avoid voiding the warranty.

Replacing an old mattress is an important decision. By understanding what drives mattress cost and what to look for in the different mattress types, you can find the perfect mattress to give you a good night's sleep without breaking the bank. The perfect fit for your sleep needs and budget is out there.

### FAQs

**What's the average cost of a good mattress?**

For a good quality queen-size mattress in Australia, you can expect to pay somewhere between $1000 and $2500. In this price range, you'll find mattresses made with high-quality materials that offer excellent support, comfort, and durability. This includes well-made hybrid mattresses with pocket springs and memory foam, high-density all-foam mattresses, and some natural latex models. While you can certainly spend more, this price bracket generally represents the sweet spot for value, where you are paying for the quality of the materials and construction rather than just brand marketing. A purchase in this range is a solid, long-term investment in your sleep quality.

**What's a good, reasonably priced mattress?**

A good, reasonably priced mattress is one that provides excellent value for your money. Typically, for a queen-size bed, this will fall in the $1000 to $2000 price range. In this category, you should look for a mattress from a direct-to-consumer brand, as they avoid the high markups of traditional retail stores. A reasonably priced mattress should feature durable materials like high-density support foam, a substantial layer of memory foam or latex for comfort, and, in the case of hybrid mattresses, a supportive core of individually wrapped pocket springs. It should also come with a sleep trial of at least 100 nights and a 10-year warranty, demonstrating the brand's confidence in its product.

**What is a reasonable price to pay for a good mattress?**

A reasonable price for a good mattress depends largely on the materials and size, but for a queen, a budget of around $1500 is very reasonable. This amount allows you to access high-quality mattresses from reputable online brands that focus on material quality over marketing hype. At this price point, you can find excellent hybrid mattresses that offer a balance of support and pressure relief, or premium all-foam mattresses with dense, durable layers. Paying much less might mean compromising on material quality and longevity. Paying significantly more often means you're covering costs for a brand's advertising or luxury features that don't substantially improve sleep quality for most people.

**Is $1000 good for a mattress?**

Yes, $1000 is a very good budget for a high-quality queen-size mattress, particularly if you shop at an online, factory-direct brand. At this price point, you can find a mattress that is a significant step up from entry-level options. For instance, at Ausbeds, our mattress range is specifically designed to offer exceptional value, and you can get an excellent mattress for around this price. You can expect to get a mattress with a solid support system, such as a quality pocket spring unit or high-density foam core, combined with comfortable and durable materials like memory foam. This price is often the starting point for mattresses that offer a great balance of performance and longevity, making it a smart investment for your sleep.
